# 180 Days of Code 🧠💻

This repo is not just a coding streak challenge—it's my personal knowledge base. I use it to track my learning, revisit concepts, and help others who might be on a similar path.

## 📘 Why this repo exists

Whenever I get stuck while building something or learning a new concept, I don’t go back to a physical notebook. I check this repository first. If I can’t find what I’m looking for here, I study official documentation (like MDN), understand it, and then make sure to **document it here** for future reference.

## 🛠️ What's inside

- JavaScript notes and snippets
- Currently working on Reactjs
- Eventually my developer journey notes,codes,snippets
- HTML/CSS might be added later, but currently my focus is on logic building and core programming

This is an evolving repo—feel free to explore, use, or contribute if you find it helpful!
